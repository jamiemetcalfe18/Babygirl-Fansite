# Babygirl-Fansite
A fansite tribute page to my dog Babygirl. This site was my final and showcases what I learned in my web foundations I class.

For this site I focused on mobile responsiveness. I highly reccomend checking it out in dev mode on your browser and see how it fits 
and responds to different sizes!

I love my dog a lot so a fansite for her was really fitting.

## Purpose Of This Project
The purpose of this project was to showcase my basic html and css skills, as well as responsive design for my final in my web foundations I class.

## What I Learned
-Got better and more confident with media queries!
-Small CSS things, like making sure to set margings, borders, and padding
-Making sure to use appropriate color schemes.
