# Babygirl-Fansite
A fansite tribute page to my dog Babygirl. This site was my final and showcases what I learned in my web foundations I class.

For this site I focused on mobile responsiveness. I highly reccomend checking it out in dev mode on your browser and see how it fits 
and responds to different sizes!

I love my dog a lot so a fansite for her was really fitting.
