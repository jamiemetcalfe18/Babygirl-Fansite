# Babygirl-Fansite
A fansite tribute page to my dog Babygirl. This site showcases what I learned in my web foundations I class.

I used html and css. The goal of this project is to showcase my abillity to use responsive design and allow the website to be responsive on a multitude of devices.

I startd this project on 12/8/2021! I am currently working on this.
