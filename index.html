          <p>Babygirl is a 9 year old <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">Black Labrador</a>. She weighs 50lbs, and loves belly rubs. She has brown eyes that look like molten orbs of chocolate in the sun, and her fur is black, with some grey mixed in as she is aging. She is very well loved by her family. Some of her favorite things to do are rolling in the dirt outside, sunbathing, playing with her bone, barking, getting belly rubs, and eating. She is the proud owner of several tennis balls and three bones.</p>
          <p>When she is not trying to persuade people to pet her belly or to give her people food, Babygirl loves napping. Whether on her bed, the carpet, someone else's bed, or the floor, she loves sleeping by her owners. She is a very loyal dog and barks at strangers or to notify you that someone just pulled into the driveway. She is a very good girl, and quite intillegent. If you are trying to get on her good side, I do not reccomend trying to bathe her or touch her ears.</p>

             <h2 class="h2color">Fun facts about Babygirl:</h2>
             <li>Despite being a Labrador, she is very afraid of water. She does not like the rain either.</li>
             <li>She is very good at catching insects, and likes to take them outside after she captures them.</li>
             <li>She once stole a whole plate of pizza rolls off of her owner's desk, ate them, and tried to hide the plate under her bed.</li>
           </ul>

          <p>The best thing about Babygirl is her personality. She comes off as a quiet pooch, but once you get to know her, she is a really silly girl. She has these soft sqeaks she does to get your attention when she wants something. If you ignore her she makes this grunt that sometimes also sounds like a laugh. She loves to play, and be petted. Lowkey, she is a lapdog. Don't let her size fool you!</p>
